Peter plays football, doesn't he?
She does a beautiful job, does not she?
But you don't really love her, do you?
This'll work, won't it?
Oh you think so, do you?
Well , I couldn't help it, could I?
But you'll tell me if she calls, won't you?
We'd never have known, would we?
Oh you do, do you?
The weather's bad, isn't it?
You won't be late, will you?
Nobody knows, do they?
You never come on time, do you?
You couldn't help me, could you?
You think you're clever, do you?
So you don't think I can do it, don't you?
Shut up, will you!
She can hardly love him after all that, can she?
Nothing will happen, will it?
